# Redux basics introduction 

This is yet another project that I implemented in order to get familiar with the ReactJS and Redux 
means and practices.

Summary: 
Weather forecast is being retrieved using `axios` ajax request.
The response is being manipulated using the best practices of Redux and ReactJS.
Some reactJS specific libraries have been used : Google maps for react, chart library for react, etc 

Its mainly made for educational purpsosed.
Always focued on writting clean readable code using best practices.
